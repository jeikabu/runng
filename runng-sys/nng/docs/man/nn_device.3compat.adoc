== NAME

nn_device - create forwarding device (compatible API)

== SYNOPSIS

[source,c]
----
#include <nanomsg/nn.h>

int nn_device(int sock1, int sock2);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nn_device()` function is used to create a forwarder, where messages
received on one of the two sockets _sock1_ and _sock2_ are forwarded to
the other.

NOTE: This function is provided for API
<<nng_compat.3compat#,compatibility>> with legacy _libnanomsg_.
Consider using the relevant <<libnng.3#,modern API>> instead.

The two sockets must be compatible, and must be <<nng.7#raw_mode,raw mode>>
sockets.
More detail about devices and how they can be used is available in the
new style <<nng_device.3#,nng_device()>> documentation.

== RETURN VALUES

This function blocks forever, and will return -1 only when
one of the sockets is closed or an error occurs.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`EBADF`:: One of the two sockets is invalid or not open, or has
`EINVAL`:: The sockets are not compatible with each other, or not both raw.
`ENOMEM`:: Insufficient memory is available.
